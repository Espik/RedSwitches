                    <h2>On the Subject of Red Switches</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">I'll flip YOUR switch...</p>

                    <p>This module has five red switches and ten red LEDs below that can either be on or off. If the switches and LEDs are not completely red, you are looking at a different module.</p>
                    
                    <p>The LEDs determine which positions the switches should be flipped to. If the upper LED is on, the switch should be flipped up. If the lower LED is on, the switch should be flipped down. To solve the module, flip all the switches so their state matches the LEDs below them.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, every time you flip a switch, it will flip a different switch and alternate which LED is on below a different switch. The same additional switch and pair of LEDs will alternate for every switch, and the switch cannot change its own pair of LEDs.</p>

                    <p>Also, the module will strike if you flip the same switch twice in a row. However, the switch will still flip as normal.</p>
